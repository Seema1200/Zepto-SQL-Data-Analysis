📖 About the Project

Hi there! 👋
Welcome to my first end-to-end SQL Data Analysis Project using a realistic dataset inspired by Zepto, a quick grocery delivery platform.

Objective:
To extract actionable business insights from product data using SQL, helping understand product trends, pricing strategies, and inventory patterns.

Dataset Columns:
sku_id, category, name, mrp, quantity,
discountPercent, availableQuantity, discountedSellingPrice,
weightInGms, outOfStock

⚙️ Steps I Followed
🗄️ 1. Data Setup

Created a SQL table to store product information (name, price, category, weight, etc.)

🔍 2. Data Exploration

Understood structure, checked missing or duplicate values

Counted products by category

🧹 3. Data Cleaning

Removed products with MRP = 0

Converted prices from paise to rupees

Removed duplicates and handled NULL values

📈 4. Analysis using SQL Queries

Top 10 best-value products (highest discounts)

High MRP but out-of-stock products

Revenue estimation by category

Categories with highest average discount

Price per gram comparison

Grouped products by weight (Low/Medium/Bulk)

Calculated total inventory weight by category

📊 Key Insights

🛒 Discount Strategy:
Fruits & Vegetables and Meats, Fish & Eggs get higher discounts due to perishability, while premium essentials keep lower discounts to protect margins.

💰 Revenue Trends:
Cooking Essentials, Munchies, and Personal Care generate the highest estimated revenue; fresh items contribute the least.

⚖️ Inventory Weight:
Cooking Essentials and Munchies dominate stock weight, while Meats, Fish & Eggs are lightest — useful for planning storage and logistics.

⚡ Best Value:
Staple items like salt and onions have the lowest price per gram, making them highly cost-effective for customers.

📦 Weight Categories:
Most products are light (<1000g), making them easier and faster to deliver.

💡 What I Learned

Writing SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE, JOIN)

Cleaning and preparing real-world-like datasets

Performing basic data analysis using SUM, AVG, COUNT

Thinking like an analyst — asking impactful business questions and presenting answers visually
