# Zepto Data Analysis: My First SQL Project ðŸŽ‰

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my first end-to-end data analysis project. I'm really excited to share this with you.

I built this project to practice my **SQL skills** and see if I could find interesting stories hidden inside a real-looking dataset from **Zepto**, a quick grocery delivery app.

## What I Did (In Simple Terms!)

I pretended I was a data analyst at Zepto. My job was to look at all their product information and answer questions that could help the business. Here's how I did it, step by step:

1.  **I Set Up My Database:** I created a table to hold all the product information like name, price, category, and whether it was in stock.

2.  **I Explored the Data:** Before I could answer any big questions, I had to understand what I was working with. I asked simple questions like:
    *   "How many products are there?"
    *   "Are there any missing details?"
    *   "What different categories do we have?"

3.  **I Cleaned the Data:** I found a few problems! Some products had a price of â‚¹0, which didn't make sense. I also noticed the prices were in paise (1 Rupee = 100 Paise), so I converted everything to rupees to make it easier to read.

4.  **I Asked Bigger Questions:** This was the fun part! I used SQL queries to find answers to questions I was curious about, like:
    *   "What are the most heavily discounted items?"
    *   "Are we missing out on money because expensive items are out of stock?"
    *   "Which category makes the most money?"
    *   "Which products give you the most for your money by weight?"

## What I Learned

This project was a huge learning experience for me. I got to practice:

*   **SQL Fundamentals:** `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
*   **Data Cleaning:** How to find and fix messy data.
*   **Basic Analysis:** Using `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` to understand data.
*   **Thinking Like an Analyst:** It's not just about writing code; it's about asking good questions.

## A Few Interesting Things I Found

*   I found the top 10 products with the biggest discounts. These would be great for a "Weekly Deals" section!
*   I discovered some expensive items that were out of stock. This means Zepto might be losing sales on these products.
*   I figured out how much the entire inventory weighs, which could help with planning delivery logistics.

Even if you're not technical, I hope this shows you how I think through a problem and my excitement for learning new skills!

### About Me

I'm just starting my journey in data analysis. I'm curious, I love solving puzzles, and I'm really enjoying learning how to find stories in data.

I'm looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a junior data analyst.
